against

and
alleged
ideological
bias
its
reliability
was
frequently
criticized
in

and
has
been
generally
praised
in

were
attempted
before

began
as
a
complementary
project
for
nupedia
a
free
online
englishlanguage
encyclopedia
project
whose

were
written
by

and
reviewed
under

and
later

nupedia
was
initially
licensed
under

even
before

was
founded
nupedia
switched

urging
of
richard
stallman
wales
is
credited
with
defining
the
goal
of
making
a
publicly
editable
encyclopedia
while
sanger
is
credited
with
the
strategy
of
using
a
wiki
to
reach
that
goal
on
january
sanger
proposed
on
the
nupedia
mailing
list
to
create
a
wiki
as
a
feeder
project
for
nupedia
the

later
redirecting
to

and

were
registered
on
january
and

respectively
and
wikipedia
was
launched
on
january
as
a
single

at
wwwwikipediacom
and
announced
by
sanger
on
the
nupedia
mailing
list
its
policy
of
neutral
pointofview
was
codified
in
its
first
few
months
otherwise
there
were
initially
relatively
few
rules
and
it
operated
independently
of
nupedia
bomis
originally
intended
it
as
a

for

coexisted

were
taken
down
permanently
in

its

was
incorporated
into

the
english
wikipedia
passed
the
mark
of
two

on

making
it
the
largest

ever
assembled
surpassing
the

made
during

held
the

for
almost
years

announced
that

would
not
display

in

the
growth

have
peaked

roughly
a

at

attributed
this
slowing
of

to
the

increasing

suggest
that

is
flattening

these
claims

the
most

types
of
vandalism
include
additions
of

and
crude

it
can
also
include

vandalism

easy

wikipedians

widely
seen
as

a

editors
this

should
be
adopted
statistical
analyses
suggest
that
the
committee
ignores
the
content
of
disputes
and
rather
focuses
on
the
way
disputes
are
conducted
functioning
not
so
much
to
resolve
disputes
and
make
peace
between
conflicting
editors
but
to
weed
out
problematic
editors
while
allowing
potentially
productive
editors
back
in
to
participate
therefore
the
committee
does
not
dictate
the
content
of
articles
although
it
sometimes
condemns
content
changes
when
it
deems
the
new
content
violates
wikipedia
policies
for
example
if
the
new

is
considered

and
probations

in
of
cases

from

or

when
complete
bans
from

are
generally
limited
to
instances
of

and
antisocial
behavior
when

is
not
impersonation

rather
anticonsensus
or
in

wikipedia
does
not
require
that
its
editors
and
contributors
provide
identification
as
wikipedia
grew
who
writes
wikipedia
became
one
of
the
questions
frequently
asked
there
jimmy
wales
once
argued
that
only
a
community
a
dedicated
group
of
a
few
hundred
volunteers
makes
the
bulk
of
contributions
to
wikipedia
and
that
the
project
is
therefore
much
like
any
traditional
organization
in
a
slate
magazine
article
reported
that
according
to
researchers
in
palo
alto
one
percent
of
wikipedia
users
are
responsible
for
about
half
of
the
sites
edits
this
method
of
evaluating
contributions
was
later
disputed
by
aaron
swartz
who
noted
that
several
articles
he
sampled
had
large
portions
of
their
content
measured
by
number
of
characters
contributed
by
users
with
low
edit
counts
the
english
wikipedia
has
articles
registered
editors
and
active
editors
an
editor
is
considered
active
if
they
have
made
one
or
more
edits
in
the
past
days
editors
who
fail
to
comply
with
wikipedia
cultural
rituals
such
as
signing
talk
page
comments
may
implicitly
signal
that
they
are
wikipedia
outsiders
increasing
the
odds
that
wikipedia
insiders
may
target
or
discount
their
contributions
becoming
a
wikipedia
insider
involves
nontrivial
costs
the
contributor
is
expected
to
learn
wikipediaspecific
technological
codes
submit
to
a
sometimes
convoluted
dispute
resolution
process
and
learn
a
baffling
culture
rich
with
injokes
and
insider
references
editors
who
do
not
log
in
are
in
some
sense
secondclass
citizens
on
wikipedia
as
participants
are
accredited
by
members
of
the
wiki
community
who
have
a
vested
interest
in
preserving
the
quality
of
the
work

on
the
basis
of
their
ongoing
participation
but
the
contribution
histories
of
anonymous
unregistered
editors
recognized
only
by
their
ip
addresses
cannot
be
attributed
to
a
particular
editor
with
certainty
a
study
by
researchers
from
dartmouth
college
found
that
anonymous
and
infrequent
contributors
to
wikipedia
are
as
reliable
a
source
of
knowledge
as
those
contributors
who
register
with
the
site
jimmy
wales
stated
in
that
it
turns
out
over
of
all
the
edits
are
done
by
just
of
the
users
people
and
in
fact
the
most
active
which
is
people
have
done
of
all
the

however
business
insider
editor
and

henry

content
measured
by
the

of

text
that
survives
to
the
latest
sampled
edit
is
created
by
outsiders
while
most
editing
and
formatting
is
done
by
insiders
a
study
found
that
wikipedians
were
less
agreeable
open
and
conscientious
than
others
although
a
later
commentary
pointed
out
serious
flaws
including
that
the
data
showed
higher
openness
and
that
the
differences
with
the
control
group
and
the
samples
were
small
according
to
a
study
there
is
evidence
of
growing
resistance
from
the
wikipedia
community
to
new
content
several
studies
have
shown
that
most
wikipedia
contributors
are
male
notably
the
results
of
a
wikimedia
foundation
survey
in
showed
that
only
percent
of
wikipedia
editors
were
female
because
of
this
universities
throughout
the
united
states
tried
to
encourage
women
to
become
wikipedia
contributors
similarly
many
of
these
universities
including
yale
and
brown
gave
college
credit
to
students
who
create
or
edit
an
article
relating
to
women
in
science
or
technology
andrew
lih
a
professor
and
scientist
wrote
in
the
new
york
times
that
the
reason
he
thought
the
number
of
male
contributors
outnumbered
the
number
of
females
so
greatly
was
because
identifying
as
a
woman
may
expose
oneself
to
ugly
intimidating
behavior

jimmy

has
described
wikipedia
as
an
effort
to
create
and
distribute
a
free
encyclopedia
of
the
highest
possible
quality
to
every
single
person
on
the
planet
in
their
own
language
though
each
language
edition
functions
more
or
less
independently
some
efforts
are
made
to
supervise
them
all
they
are
coordinated
in

by

to

metawiki
provides

every

have
the
list
concerns
basic
content
by

biography
history
geography
society
culture
science

and

it
is
not
rare
for
articles
strongly
related
to
a
particular
language
not
to
have
counterparts
in
another
edition
for
example
articles
about
small
towns
in

might
be
available
only
in
english
even
when
they
meet
the
notability
criteria
of

language
wikipedia
projects
translated
articles
represent
only
a
small
portion
of
articles
in
most
editions
in
part
because
those
editions
do
not
allow
fully
automated
translation
of

roy
rosenzweig
a
history
professor
stated
that
american
national
biography
online
outperformed
wikipedia
in
terms
of
its
clear
and
engaging
prose
which
he
said
was
an
important
aspect
of
good
historical
writing
contrasting
wikipedias
treatment
of
abraham
lincoln
to
that
of
civil
war
historian
james
mcpherson
in
american
national
biography
online
he
said
that
both
were
essentially
accurate
and
covered
the
major
episodes
in
lincolns
life
but
praised
mcphersons
richer
contextualization
his
artful
use
of
quotations
to
capture
lincolns
voice
and
his
ability
to
convey
a
profound
message
in
a
handful
of
words
by
contrast
he
gives
an
example
of
wikipedias
prose
that
he
finds
both
verbose
and
dull
rosenzweig
also
criticized
the
wafflingencouraged
by
the
npov
policywhich
means
that
it
is
hard
to
discern
any
overall
interpretive
stance
in
wikipedia
history
while
generally
praising
the
article
on
william
clarke
quantrill
he
quoted
its
conclusion
as
an
example
of
such
waffling
which
then
stated
some
historians
remember
him
as
an
opportunistic
bloodthirsty
outlaw
while
others
continue
to
view
him
as
a
daring
soldier
and
local
folk
hero
other
critics
have
made
similar
charges
that
even
if
wikipedia
articles
are
factually
accurate
they
are
often
written
in
a
poor
almost
unreadable
style
frequent
wikipedia
critic
andrew
orlowski
commented
even
when
a
wikipedia
entry
is
percent
factually
correct
and
those
facts
have
been
carefully
chosen
it
all
too
often
reads
as

has
been
translated

the

be

in

and
excluded
those

lawrence
found
the
articles
accurate
but
not
very
readable
and
thought
that
wikipedias
lack
of
readability
to
noncollege
readers
may
reflect
its
varied
origins
and
haphazard
editing
the
economist
argued
that
betterwritten
articles
tend
to
be
more
reliable
inelegant

that

the

a

the
redistribution
creation
of

and
commercial
use
of

while

retain

of
their
work
the
gfdl
was
created
for
software
manuals
that
come
with
free
software
programs
licensed
under
the
gpl
this
made
it
a
poor
choice
for
a
general
reference
work
for
example
the
gfdl
requires
the
reprints
of
materials
from

to
come
with
a
full

of
the
gfdl
text
in
december
the
creative

license
was
released
it
was
specifically
designed
for
creative

in
general
not
just
for
software
manuals
the
license
gained
popularity
among
bloggers
and
others
distributing
creative
works
on
the

the
wikipedia
project
sought
the
switch
to
the

because
the
two

gfdl
and

were
incompatible
in

following
the

the

accommodation
of

regarding

has
led
some
to
observe
that
its
photographic
coverage
of

lags
behind
the
quality
of
the
encyclopedic
text
the
wikimedia
foundation
is
not
a
licensor
of
content
but
merely
a
hosting
service
for
the
contributors
and
licensors
of
the
wikipedia
this
position
has
been
successfully
defended
in
court
because
wikipedia
content
is
distributed
under
an
open
license
anyone
can
reuse
or
redistribute
it
at
no
charge
the
content
of
wikipedia
has
been
published
in
many
forms
both
online
and
offline
outside
the
wikipedia
website
obtaining
the
full
contents
of
wikipedia
for
reuse
presents
challenges
since
direct
cloning
via
a
web
crawler
is
discouraged
wikipedia
publishes
dumps
of
its

but
these
are
textonly

one

hossein

describes
wikipedia
as
one
of
the
last
remaining
pillars
of
the
open
and
decentralized
web
and
contrasted
its
existence
as
a
textbased
source
of

with

and

services

having

wikipedias
goal
as
an
encyclopedia
represents
the
age
of
enlightenment
tradition
of
rationality
triumphing
over
emotions
a
trend
which
he
considers
endangered
due
to
the
gradual
shift
from
a
typographic
culture
to
a
photographic
one
which
in
turn
means
a
shift
from
rationality
to
emotions
exposition
to
entertainment
rather
than
sapere
aude
litdare
to
know
social
networks
have
led
to
a
culture
of
dare
not
to
care
to
know
this
is
while
wikipedia
faces
a
more
concerning
problem
than
funding
namely
a
flattening
growth
rate
in
the
number
of
contributors
to
the
website
consequently
the
challenge
for
wikipedia
and
those
who
use
it
is
to
save
wikipedia
and
its
promise
of
a
free
and
open
collection
of
all
human
knowledge
amid
the
conquest
of
new

collect

he
resorted

at

a

times

had
never

caught
it
out
he
described
it
as
a
work

as
useful

so
wide
a
range
that
it
is
almost
impossible
to
find

the

a
essay
the
amorality

criticized

like

for
possibly
leading

in

out

for
one
cant
imagine
anything
more
frightening

dispute
the
notion
that

similar
efforts
will
entirely
displace

chris

the

of

wrote
in

that
the
wisdom
of
crowds
approach
of
wikipedia
will
not
displace
top
scientific
journals
with
their
rigorous
peer
review
process
there
is
also
an
ongoing
debate
about
the
influence
of
wikipedia
on
the
biography
publishing
business
the
worry
is
that
if
you
can
get
all
that
information
from

whats
left
for
biography

several
interactive
multimedia
encyclopedias
incorporating

written
by

existed
long
before
wikipedia
was
founded
the
first
of
these
was
the
bbc
domesday
project
which
included
text
entered
on
bbc
micro
computers
and
photographs
from
more
than
a
million
contributors
in
the
uk
and
covered
the
geography
art
and
culture
of
the
uk
this
was
the
first
interactive
multimedia
encyclopedia
and
was
also
the
first
major
multimedia
document
connected
through
internal
links
with
the
majority
of
articles
being
accessible
through
an
interactive
map
of
the
uk
the
user
interface
and
part
of
the
content
of
the
domesday
project
were
emulated
on
a
website
until
several
freecontent
collaborative
encyclopedias
were
created
around
the
same
period
as
wikipedia
eg
everything
with
many
later
being
merged
into

in

relatively
lighthearted
focusing
on
articles
which
are
both
witty

subsequent
collaborative

have
drawn

some

and

likewise
employ
no
formal

although
some
like

are
not

needed
others
use
more
traditional
peer

such
as
encyclopedia
of

and
the
online
wiki
encyclopedias
scholarpedia
and

the

was
